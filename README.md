# Small Multiples test

A first step of playing with d3, from tutorial by the good folks at [webkid.io](http://blog.webkid.io/multiple-maps-d3/).

Code needs to be run from a local server for it to work correctly.  See https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki#installing for python, ruby, php code for firing up a local server with those languages.  

I used ruby.  To do so, type `ruby -run -e httpd . -p 8888` from your project working directory in Terminal, and go to http://localhost:8888/ in your browser.
